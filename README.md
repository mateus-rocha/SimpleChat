SimpleChat - Server
==========

Simple chat program using the ocsf framework to work with OpDemand.

To Run
------
From command line  
`cd` into directory.  
Then `java EchoServer [port]`
  
Note: the server console is currently dissabled so that the process can be run in the background. Re-enable by uncommenting lines 27-42. (Use of the server console is the same as the [Client Console](https://github.com/mattloidolt/SimpleChat) minus the blocking and adding `#stop` and `#close`)
